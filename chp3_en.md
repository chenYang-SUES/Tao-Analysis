# Set Theory

Modern analysis, like most other subfields of modern mathematics, is concerned with numbers, sets, and geometry.We have already introduced one type of number system, the natural numbers. We will introduce the other number systems shortly, but for now we pause to introduce the concepts and notation of set theory, as they will be used increasingly heavily in later chapters. (We will not pursue a rigorous description of Euclidean geometry in this text, preferring instead to describe that geometry in terms of real number system by means of Cartesian co-ordinate system.)

While set theory is not the main focus of this text, almost every other branch of mathematics relies on set theory as part of its foundation, so it is important to get at least some grounding in set theory before doing other advanced areas of mathematics. In this chapter we present the more elementary aspects of axiomatic set theory, leaving more advanced topics such as discussion of infinite sets and the axiom of choice to Chap. 8. A full treatment of the finer subtleties of set theory (of which there are many!) is unfortunately well beyond the scope of this text.

## 3.1 Fundamentals

In this section we shall set out some axioms for sets, just as we did for the natural numbers. For pedagogical reasons, we will use a somewhat overcomplete list of axioms for set theory, in the sense that some of the axioms can be used to deduce others, but there is no real harm in doing this. We begin with an informal description of what sets should be.

> **Definition 3.1.1** (*Informal*) We define a *set* $A$ to be any unordered colleciton of objects, e.g., $\{3,8,5,2\}$ is set. If $x$ is an object, we say that $x$ is *an element of* $A$ or $x \in A$ if $x$ lies in the collection; otherwise we say that $x \notin A$. For instance $3 \in \left \{1,2,3,4,5 \right \}$ but $7 \notin \left \{1,2,3,4,5  \right \}$.

This definition is intuitive enough, but it doesn't answer a number of questions, such as which collections of objects are considered to be sets, which sets are equal to other sets, and how one defines operations on sets (e.g., unions, intersections, etc.). Also, we have not axioms yet on what sets do, or what their elements do. Obtaining these axioms and defining these operations will be the purpose of the remainder of this section.

We first clarify one point: we consider sets themselves to be a type of object.

> **Axiom 3.1** (*Sets are objects*). If $A$ is a set, then $A$ is also an object. In particular, given two sets $A$ and $B$, it is meaningful to ask whether $A$ is also an element of $B$.

**_Example 3.1.2_** (Informal) The set $\left \{ 3, \left \{ 3,4 \right \},4  \right \}$ is a set of three distinct elements, one of which happens to itself to be a set of two elements. See Example 3.1.9 for a more formal version of this example.

**_Remark 3.1.3_** There is a special case of set theory, called "pure set theory", in which _all_ objects are sets; for instance the number $0$ might be identified with the empty set $\emptyset = \left \{  \right \}$, the number $1$ might be identified with $\left \{  0\right \}=\left \{  \left \{  \right \} \right \}$, the number $2$ might be identified with $\left \{0,1\right \}=\left \{\left \{  \right \} ,\left \{\left \{  \right \}   \right \}   \right \}$, and so forth. From a logical point of view, pure set theory is a simpler theory, since one only has to deal with sets and not with objects; however, from a conceptual point of view it is often easier to deal with impure set theories in which some objects are not considered to be sets. The two types of theories are more or less equivalent for the purposes of doing mathematics, an so we shall take an agnostic position as to whether all objects are sets or nots. For instance, we do not insist that a natural number such as $3$ be identified with a set as indicated above. (The more accurate and mathematically useful statement is that natural numbers can be cardinalities of sets, rather than necessarily being sets themselves. See Sect. 3.6.)

To summarize so far, among all the objects studied in mathematics, some of the objects happen to be sets; and if $x$ is an object and $A$ is a set, then either $x \in A$ true or $x \in A$ is false. (If $A$ is not a set, we leave the statement $x \in A$ undefined; for instance, we consider the statement $3 \in 4$ to neither be true or false, but simply meaningless, since $4$ is not a set.)

Next, we try to capture the notion of equality: when are two sets considered to be equal? We do not consider the order of the elements inside a set to be important; thus we think of $\left \{3,8,5,2\right \}$ and $\left \{2,3,5,8\right \}$ as the same set. On the other hand, $\left \{3,8,5,2\right \}$ and $\left \{3,8,5,2,1 \right \}$ are different sets because the latter set contains an element that the former one does not, namely the element $1$. For similar reasons $\left \{3,8,5,2\right \}$ and $\left \{3,8,5\right \}$ are different sets. We formalize this by a further axiom:

> **Axiom 3.2** (_Equality of sets_). Two sets $A$ and $B$ are _equal_, $A=B$, iff every element of $A$ is an element of $B$ and vice versa. To put it another weay, $A = B$ if and only if every element of $x$ of $A$ belongs also to $B$, and every element $y$ of $B$ belongs also to $A$.

**_Example 3.1.4_** Thus, for instance, $\left \{1,2,3,4,5\right \}$ and $\left \{3,4,2,1,5\right \}$ are the same set, since they contain exactly the same elements. (The set $\left \{3,3,1,5,2,4,2\right \}$ is also equal to $\left \{1,2,3,4,5\right \}$; the repetition of $3$ and $2$ is irrelevant as it does not further change the status of $2$ and $3$ being elements of the sets.)

The "is an element of" relation $\in$ obeys the axiom of substitution (see Section A.7). Because of this, any new operation we define on sets will also obey the axiom of substitution, as long as we can define that operation purely in terms of the relation $\in$. This is for instance the case for the remaining definitions in this section. (on the other hand, we cannot use the notion of the "first" or "last" element in a set in a well-defined manner, because this would not respect the axiom of substitution; for instance the sets $\left \{1,2,3,4,5\right \}$ and $\left \{3,4,2,1,5\right \}$ are the same set, but have different first elements.)
